Lightwieght POS that brings the speed and ease of UPC bar codes to web3. Platform lets vendors easily manage sales and inventory. And makes it even easier for customers to shop with them.

## Administrative (ENS)

Vendors can add the hours and locations for their <a href="https://tools.ens.domains/setprmanager">Shop</a> with ENS Text Records so they can market publicly to everyone on chain.

The Governing smartcontract of the platform can add and remove Shop smartcontracts <a href="https://app.ens.domains/ethrometesting.eth">ethrometesting.eth</a>.

## Transactions (Peanut protocol)

Not only can web3 vendors accept Crypto payments now, they can also accept FIAT currency digitally. Mensola uses the <a href="https://peanut.to/">Peanut Protocol</a> for all sales to make payments between vendors and customers simple and fast.
